# My_Computer_Vision_Journey
This repository documents my progress as I start my computer vision journey. Stay tuned for updates, it's going to be fun !!!

# Introduction: 
The goal of computer vision is to understand the story unfodling in a picture. As humans, this is quite simple. But for computers, the task is extremely difficult. Computer Vision is now prevalent in many ares of our life, wheter we realize it or not. We apply computer vision algorithms to analyze movies, football games, hand gesture recognition (for sign language), license plates (in case you were driving too fast), medecine, surgery, military, and retail. Computer Vision is even used in space! NASAS'a Mars Rover includes capabilites to model the terrain of the planet, detect obstacles in its path, and stitch together panoramic images. The list will continue to grow in the coming years. Certainly, computer vision is an exciting field with endless possibilities.
